# 使用场景 #

A typical batch program generally reads a large number of records from a database, file, or queue, processes the data in some fashion, and then writes back data in a modified form. Spring Batch automates this basic batch iteration, providing the capability to process similar transactions as a set, typically in an offline environment without any user interaction. Batch jobs are part of most IT projects and Spring Batch is the only open source framework that provides a robust, enterprise-scale solution.

## Business Scenarios ##

- Commit batch process periodically
- Concurrent batch processing: parallel processing of a job
- Staged, enterprise message-driven processing
- Massively parallel batch processing
- Manual or scheduled restart after failure
- Sequential processing of dependent steps (with extensions to workflow-driven batches)
- Partial processing: skip records (e.g. on rollback)
- Whole-batch transaction: for cases with a small batch size or existing stored procedures/scripts

## Technical Objectives ##

- Batch developers use the Spring programming model: concentrate on business logic; let the framework take care of infrastructure.
- Clear separation of concerns between the infrastructure, the batch execution environment, and the batch application.
- Provide common, core execution services as interfaces that all projects can implement.
- Provide simple and default implementations of the core execution interfaces that can be used ‘out of the box’.
- Easy to configure, customize, and extend services, by leveraging the spring framework in all layers.
- All existing core services should be easy to replace or extend, without any impact to the infrastructure layer.
- Provide a simple deployment model, with the architecture JARs completely separate from the application, built using Maven.
