# Spring Batch架构

Spring Batch is designed with extensibility and a diverse group of end users in mind. The figure below shows a sketch of the layered architecture that supports the extensibility and ease of use for end-user developers.

图1.1: Spring Batch 层次架构

This layered architecture highlights three major high level components: Application, Core, and Infrastructure. The application contains all batch jobs and custom code written by developers using Spring Batch. The Batch Core contains the core runtime classes necessary to launch and control a batch job. It includes things such as a **JobLauncher**, **Job**, and **Step** implementations. Both Application and Core are built on top of a common infrastructure. This infrastructure contains common readers and writers, and services such as the **RetryTemplate**, which are used both by application developers( **ItemReader** and **ItemWriter** ) and the core framework itself.
