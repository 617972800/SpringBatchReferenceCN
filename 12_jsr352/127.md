## 12.7 Contexts

JSR-352 defines two context objects that are used to interact with the meta-data of a job or step from within a batch artifact: javax.batch.runtime.context.JobContext and javax.batch.runtime.context.StepContext. Both of these are available in any step level artifact (Batchlet, ItemReader, etc) with the JobContext being available to job level artifacts as well (JobListener for example).

To obtain a reference to the JobContext or StepContext within the current scope, simply use the @Inject annotation:

	@Inject
	JobContext jobContext;
        
> #### [Note]	@Autowire for JSR-352 contexts ####
> Using Spring's @Autowire is not supported for the injection of these contexts.

In Spring Batch, the JobContext and StepContext wrap their corresponding execution objects (JobExecution and StepExecution respectively). Data stored via `StepContext#persistent#setPersistentUserData`(Serializable data) is stored in the Spring Batch StepExecution#executionContext.
