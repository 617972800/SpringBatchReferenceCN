## 12.3 依赖注入

JSR-352 is based heavily on the Spring Batch programming model. As such, while not explicitly requiring a formal dependency injection implementation, DI of some kind implied. Spring Batch supports all three methods for loading batch artifacts defined by JSR-352:

- Implementation Specific Loader - Spring Batch is built upon Spring and so supports Spring dependency injection within JSR-352 batch jobs.
- Archive Loader - JSR-352 defines the existing of a batch.xml file that provides mappings between a logical name and a class name. This file must be found within the /META-INF/ directory if it is used.
- Thread Context Class Loader - JSR-352 allows configurations to specify batch artifact implementations in their JSL by providing the fully qualified class name inline. Spring Batch supports this as well in JSR-352 configured jobs.

To use Spring dependency injection within a JSR-352 based batch job consists of configuring batch artifacts using a Spring application context as beans. Once the beans have been defined, a job can refer to them as it would any bean defined within the batch.xml.

	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
	          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
	          xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
	                              http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
	                              http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee
	                              http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee/jobXML_1_0.xsd">
	
	    <!-- javax.batch.api.Batchlet implementation -->
	    <bean id="fooBatchlet" class="io.spring.FooBatchlet">
	            <property name="prop" value="bar"/>
	    </bean>
	
	    <!-- Job is defined using the JSL schema provided in JSR-352 -->
	    <job id="fooJob" xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee" version="1.0">
	        <step id="step1">
	            <batchlet ref="fooBatchlet"/>
	        </step>
	    </job>
	</beans>
        

The assembly of Spring contexts (imports, etc) works with JSR-352 jobs just as it would with any other Spring based application. The only difference with a JSR-352 based job is that the entry point for the context definition will be the job definition found in /META-INF/batch-jobs/.

To use the thread context class loader approach, all you need to do is provide the fully qualified class name as the ref. It is important to note that when using this approach or the batch.xml approach, the class referenced requires a no argument constructor which will be used to create the bean.

	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<job id="fooJob" xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee" version="1.0">
	    <step id="step1" >
	        <batchlet ref="io.spring.FooBatchlet" />
	    </step>
	</job>
