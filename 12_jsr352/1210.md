##12.10 Testing

Since all JSR-352 based jobs are executed asynchronously, it can be difficult to determine when a job has completed. To help with testing, Spring Batch provides the org.springframework.batch.core.jsr.JsrTestUtils. This utility class provides the ability to start a job and restart a job and wait for it to complete. Once the job completes, the associated JobExecution is returned.
