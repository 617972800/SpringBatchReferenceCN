## 12.5 处理模型( Processing Models)

JSR-352 支持和 Spring Batch 一样的两者基本处理模型:

- 基于 Item 的处理 - 通过 `javax.batch.api.chunk.ItemReader`, 以及可选的 `javax.batch.api.chunk.ItemProcessor`, 加上 `javax.batch.api.chunk.ItemWriter`.
- 基于 Task 的处理 - 使用 `javax.batch.api.Batchlet`  的实现. 当前此模型和基于 `org.springframework.batch.core.step.tasklet.Tasklet` 的处理是一样的.

### 12.5.1 Item based processing

Item based processing in this context is a chunk size being set by the number of items read by an ItemReader. To configure a step this way, specify the item-count (which defaults to 10) and optionally configure the checkpoint-policy as item (this is the default).

	...
	<step id="step1">
	    <chunk checkpoint-policy="item" item-count="3">
	        <reader ref="fooReader"/>
	        <processor ref="fooProcessor"/>
	        <writer ref="fooWriter"/>
	    </chunk>
	</step>
	...

If item based checkpointing is chosen, an additional attribute time-limit is supported. This sets a time limit for how long the number of items specified has to be processed. If the timeout is reached, the chunk will complete with however many items have been read by then regardless of what the item-count is configured to be.

### 12.5.2 Custom checkpointing

JSR-352 calls the process around the commit interval within a step "checkpointing". Item based checkpointing is one approach as mentioned above. However, this will not be robust enough in many cases. Because of this, the spec allows for the implementation of a custom checkpointing algorithm by implementing the javax.batch.api.chunk.CheckpointAlgorithm interface. This functionality is functionally the same as Spring Batch's custom completion policy. To use an implementation of CheckpointAlgorithm, configure your step with the custom checkpoint-policy as shown below where fooCheckpointer refers to an implementation of CheckpointAlgorithm.

	...
	<step id="step1">
	    <chunk checkpoint-policy="custom">
	        <checkpoint-algorithm ref="fooCheckpointer"/>
	        <reader ref="fooReader"/>
	        <processor ref="fooProcessor"/>
	        <writer ref="fooWriter"/>
	    </chunk>
	</step>
	...
