# 6.8 Multi-File Input #

It is a common requirement to process multiple files within a single **Step**. Assuming the files all have the same formatting, the **MultiResourceItemReader** supports this type of input for both XML and flat file processing. Consider the following files in a directory:

	file-1.txt  file-2.txt  ignored.txt

file-1.txt and file-2.txt are formatted the same and for business reasons should be processed together. The **MuliResourceItemReader** can be used to read in both files by using wildcards:

	<bean id="multiResourceReader" class="org.spr...MultiResourceItemReader">
	    <property name="resources" value="classpath:data/input/file-*.txt" />
	    <property name="delegate" ref="flatFileItemReader" />
	</bean>


The referenced delegate is a simple **FlatFileItemReader**. The above configuration will read input from both files, handling rollback and restart scenarios. It should be noted that, as with any **ItemReader**, adding extra input (in this case a file) could cause potential issues when restarting. It is recommended that batch jobs work with their own individual directories until completed successfully.
