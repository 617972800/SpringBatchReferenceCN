# 6.4 ItemStream #

Both **ItemReader**s and **ItemWriter**s serve their individual purposes well, but there is a common concern among both of them that necessitates another interface. In general, as part of the scope of a batch job, readers and writers need to be opened, closed, and require a mechanism for persisting state:

	public interface ItemStream {
	
	    void open(ExecutionContext executionContext) throws ItemStreamException;
	
	    void update(ExecutionContext executionContext) throws ItemStreamException;
	
	    void close() throws ItemStreamException;
	}

Before describing each method, we should mention the **ExecutionContext**. Clients of an **ItemReader** that also implement **ItemStream** should call **open** before any calls to **read** in order to open any resources such as files or to obtain connections. A similar restriction applies to an **ItemWriter** that implements **ItemStream**. As mentioned in Chapter 2, if expected data is found in the **ExecutionContext**, it may be used to start the **ItemReader** or **ItemWriter** at a location other than its initial state. Conversely, **close** will be called to ensure that any resources allocated during **open** will be released safely. **update** is called primarily to ensure that any state currently being held is loaded into the provided **ExecutionContext**. This method will be called before committing, to ensure that the current state is persisted in the database before commit.

In the special case where the client of an **ItemStream** is a **Step** (from the Spring Batch Core), an **ExecutionContext** is created for each **StepExecution** to allow users to store the state of a particular execution, with the expectation that it will be returned if the same **JobInstance** is started again. For those familiar with Quartz, the semantics are very similar to a Quartz **JobDataMap**.
