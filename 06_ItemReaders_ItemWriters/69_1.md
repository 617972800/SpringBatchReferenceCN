## 6.9.1 Cursor Based ItemReaders ##

Using a database cursor is generally the default approach of most batch developers, because it is the database's solution to the problem of 'streaming' relational data. The Java *ResultSet* class is essentially an object orientated mechanism for manipulating a cursor. A *ResultSet* maintains a cursor to the current row of data. Calling next on a *ResultSet* moves this cursor to the next row. Spring Batch cursor based *ItemReaders* open the a cursor on initialization, and move the cursor forward one row for every call to read, returning a mapped object that can be used for processing. The close method will then be called to ensure all resources are freed up. The Spring core *JdbcTemplate* gets around this problem by using the callback pattern to completely map all rows in a *ResultSet* and close before returning control back to the method caller. However, in batch this must wait until the step is complete. Below is a generic diagram of how a cursor based ItemReader works, and while a SQL statement is used as an example since it is so widely known, any technology could implement the basic approach:

This example illustrates the basic pattern. Given a 'FOO' table, which has three columns: ID, NAME, and BAR, select all rows with an ID greater than 1 but less than 7. This puts the beginning of the cursor (row 1) on ID 2. The result of this row should be a completely mapped Foo object. Calling read() again moves the cursor to the next row, which is the Foo with an ID of 3. The results of these reads will be written out after each read, thus allowing the objects to be garbage collected (assuming no instance variables are maintaining references to them).

**JdbcCursorItemReader**

JdbcCursorItemReader is the Jdbc implementation of the cursor based technique. It works directly with a ResultSet and requires a SQL statement to run against a connection obtained from a DataSource. The following database schema will be used as an example:

	CREATE TABLE CUSTOMER (
	   ID BIGINT IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
	   NAME VARCHAR(45),
	   CREDIT FLOAT
	);

Many people prefer to use a domain object for each row, so we'll use an implementation of the *RowMapper* interface to map a *CustomerCredit* object:

	public class CustomerCreditRowMapper implements RowMapper {
	
	    public static final String ID_COLUMN = "id";
	    public static final String NAME_COLUMN = "name";
	    public static final String CREDIT_COLUMN = "credit";
	
	    public Object mapRow(ResultSet rs, int rowNum) throws SQLException {
	        CustomerCredit customerCredit = new CustomerCredit();
	
	        customerCredit.setId(rs.getInt(ID_COLUMN));
	        customerCredit.setName(rs.getString(NAME_COLUMN));
	        customerCredit.setCredit(rs.getBigDecimal(CREDIT_COLUMN));
	
	        return customerCredit;
	    }
	}

Because *JdbcTemplate* is so familiar to users of Spring, and the *JdbcCursorItemReader* shares key interfaces with it, it is useful to see an example of how to read in this data with *JdbcTemplate*, in order to contrast it with the *ItemReader*. For the purposes of this example, let's assume there are 1,000 rows in the CUSTOMER database. The first example will be using *JdbcTemplate*:

	//For simplicity sake, assume a dataSource has already been obtained
	JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate = new JdbcTemplate(dataSource);
	List customerCredits = jdbcTemplate.query("SELECT ID, NAME, CREDIT from CUSTOMER",
	                                          new CustomerCreditRowMapper());


After running this code snippet the customerCredits list will contain 1,000 *CustomerCredit* objects. In the query method, a connection will be obtained from the *DataSource*, the provided SQL will be run against it, and the *mapRow* method will be called for each row in the *ResultSet*. Let's contrast this with the approach of the *JdbcCursorItemReader*:

	JdbcCursorItemReader itemReader = new JdbcCursorItemReader();
	itemReader.setDataSource(dataSource);
	itemReader.setSql("SELECT ID, NAME, CREDIT from CUSTOMER");
	itemReader.setRowMapper(new CustomerCreditRowMapper());
	int counter = 0;
	ExecutionContext executionContext = new ExecutionContext();
	itemReader.open(executionContext);
	Object customerCredit = new Object();
	while(customerCredit != null){
	    customerCredit = itemReader.read();
	    counter++;
	}
	itemReader.close(executionContext);


After running this code snippet the counter will equal 1,000. If the code above had put the returned customerCredit into a list, the result would have been exactly the same as with the *JdbcTemplate* example. However, the big advantage of the *ItemReader* is that it allows items to be 'streamed'. The read method can be called once, and the item written out via an *ItemWriter*, and then the next item obtained via *read*. This allows item reading and writing to be done in 'chunks' and committed periodically, which is the essence of high performance batch processing. Furthermore, it is very easily configured for injection into a Spring Batch *Step*:

	<bean id="itemReader" class="org.spr...JdbcCursorItemReader">
	    <property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource"/>
	    <property name="sql" value="select ID, NAME, CREDIT from CUSTOMER"/>
	    <property name="rowMapper">
	        <bean class="org.springframework.batch.sample.domain.CustomerCreditRowMapper"/>
	    </property>
	</bean>

**Additional Properties**

Because there are so many varying options for opening a cursor in Java, there are many properties on the *JdbcCustorItemReader* that can be set:

**Table 6.2. JdbcCursorItemReader Properties**

	ignoreWarnings	Determines whether or not SQLWarnings are logged or cause an exception - default is true
	fetchSize	Gives the Jdbc driver a hint as to the number of rows that should be fetched from the database when more rows are needed by the ResultSet object used by the ItemReader. By default, no hint is given.
	maxRows	Sets the limit for the maximum number of rows the underlying ResultSet can hold at any one time.
	queryTimeout	Sets the number of seconds the driver will wait for a Statement object to execute to the given number of seconds. If the limit is exceeded, a DataAccessEception is thrown. (Consult your driver vendor documentation for details).
	verifyCursorPosition	Because the same ResultSet held by the ItemReader is passed to the RowMapper, it is possible for users to call ResultSet.next() themselves, which could cause issues with the reader's internal count. Setting this value to true will cause an exception to be thrown if the cursor position is not the same after the RowMapper call as it was before.
	saveState	Indicates whether or not the reader's state should be saved in the ExecutionContext provided by ItemStream#update(ExecutionContext) The default value is true.
	driverSupportsAbsolute	Defaults to false. Indicates whether the Jdbc driver supports setting the absolute row on a ResultSet. It is recommended that this is set to true for Jdbc drivers that supports ResultSet.absolute() as it may improve performance, especially if a step fails while working with a large data set.
	setUseSharedExtendedConnection	Defaults to false. Indicates whether the connection used for the cursor should be used by all other processing thus sharing the same transaction. If this is set to false, which is the default, then the cursor will be opened using its own connection and will not participate in any transactions started for the rest of the step processing. If you set this flag to true then you must wrap the DataSource in an ExtendedConnectionDataSourceProxy to prevent the connection from being closed and released after each commit. When you set this option to true then the statement used to open the cursor will be created with both 'READ_ONLY' and 'HOLD_CUSORS_OVER_COMMIT' options. This allows holding the cursor open over transaction start and commits performed in the step processing. To use this feature you need a database that supports this and a Jdbc driver supporting Jdbc 3.0 or later.



**HibernateCursorItemReader**

Just as normal Spring users make important decisions about whether or not to use ORM solutions, which affect whether or not they use a JdbcTemplate or a HibernateTemplate, Spring Batch users have the same options. HibernateCursorItemReader is the Hibernate implementation of the cursor technique. Hibernate's usage in batch has been fairly controversial. This has largely been because Hibernate was originally developed to support online application styles. However, that doesn't mean it can't be used for batch processing. The easiest approach for solving this problem is to use a StatelessSession rather than a standard session. This removes all of the caching and dirty checking hibernate employs that can cause issues in a batch scenario. For more information on the differences between stateless and normal hibernate sessions, refer to the documentation of your specific hibernate release. The HibernateCursorItemReader allows you to declare an HQL statement and pass in a SessionFactory, which will pass back one item per call to read in the same basic fashion as the JdbcCursorItemReader. Below is an example configuration using the same 'customer credit' example as the JDBC reader:

	HibernateCursorItemReader itemReader = new HibernateCursorItemReader();
	itemReader.setQueryString("from CustomerCredit");
	//For simplicity sake, assume sessionFactory already obtained.
	itemReader.setSessionFactory(sessionFactory);
	itemReader.setUseStatelessSession(true);
	int counter = 0;
	ExecutionContext executionContext = new ExecutionContext();
	itemReader.open(executionContext);
	Object customerCredit = new Object();
	while(customerCredit != null){
	    customerCredit = itemReader.read();
	    counter++;
	}
	itemReader.close(executionContext);


This configured ItemReader will return CustomerCredit objects in the exact same manner as described by the JdbcCursorItemReader, assuming hibernate mapping files have been created correctly for the Customer table. The 'useStatelessSession' property defaults to true, but has been added here to draw attention to the ability to switch it on or off. It is also worth noting that the fetchSize of the underlying cursor can be set via the setFetchSize property. As with JdbcCursorItemReader, configuration is straightforward:

	<bean id="itemReader"
	      class="org.springframework.batch.item.database.HibernateCursorItemReader">
	    <property name="sessionFactory" ref="sessionFactory" />
	    <property name="queryString" value="from CustomerCredit" />
	</bean>


**StoredProcedureItemReader**

Sometimes it is necessary to obtain the cursor data using a stored procedure. The StoredProcedureItemReader works like the JdbcCursorItemReader except that instead of executing a query to obtain a cursor we execute a stored procedure that returns a cursor. The stored procedure can return the cursor in three different ways:

1. as a returned ResultSet (used by SQL Server, Sybase, DB2, Derby and MySQL)
1. as a ref-cursor returned as an out parameter (used by Oracle and PostgreSQL)
1. as the return value of a stored function call

Below is a basic example configuration using the same 'customer credit' example as earlier:

	<bean id="reader" class="o.s.batch.item.database.StoredProcedureItemReader">
	    <property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource"/>
	    <property name="procedureName" value="sp_customer_credit"/>
	    <property name="rowMapper">
	        <bean class="org.springframework.batch.sample.domain.CustomerCreditRowMapper"/>
	    </property>
	</bean>

This example relies on the stored procedure to provide a ResultSet as a returned result (option 1 above).

If the stored procedure returned a ref-cursor (option 2) then we would need to provide the position of the out parameter that is the returned ref-cursor. Here is an example where the first parameter is the returned ref-cursor:

	<bean id="reader" class="o.s.batch.item.database.StoredProcedureItemReader">
	    <property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource"/>
	    <property name="procedureName" value="sp_customer_credit"/>
	    <property name="refCursorPosition" value="1"/>
	    <property name="rowMapper">
	        <bean class="org.springframework.batch.sample.domain.CustomerCreditRowMapper"/>
	    </property>
	</bean>

If the cursor was returned from a stored function (option 3) we would need to set the property "function" to true. It defaults to false. Here is what that would look like:

	<bean id="reader" class="o.s.batch.item.database.StoredProcedureItemReader">
	    <property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource"/>
	    <property name="procedureName" value="sp_customer_credit"/>
	    <property name="function" value="true"/>
	    <property name="rowMapper">
	        <bean class="org.springframework.batch.sample.domain.CustomerCreditRowMapper"/>
	    </property>
	</bean>

In all of these cases we need to define a RowMapper as well as a DataSource and the actual procedure name.

If the stored procedure or function takes in parameter then they must be declared and set via the parameters property. Here is an example for Oracle that declares three parameters. The first one is the out parameter that returns the ref-cursor, the second and third are in parameters that takes a value of type INTEGER:

	<bean id="reader" class="o.s.batch.item.database.StoredProcedureItemReader">
	    <property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource"/>
	    <property name="procedureName" value="spring.cursor_func"/>
	    <property name="parameters">
	        <list>
	            <bean class="org.springframework.jdbc.core.SqlOutParameter">
	                <constructor-arg index="0" value="newid"/>
	                <constructor-arg index="1">
	                    <util:constant static-field="oracle.jdbc.OracleTypes.CURSOR"/>
	                </constructor-arg>
	            </bean>
	            <bean class="org.springframework.jdbc.core.SqlParameter">
	                <constructor-arg index="0" value="amount"/>
	                <constructor-arg index="1">
	                    <util:constant static-field="java.sql.Types.INTEGER"/>
	                </constructor-arg>
	            </bean>
	            <bean class="org.springframework.jdbc.core.SqlParameter">
	                <constructor-arg index="0" value="custid"/>
	                <constructor-arg index="1">
	                    <util:constant static-field="java.sql.Types.INTEGER"/>
	                </constructor-arg>
	            </bean>
	        </list>
	    </property>
	    <property name="refCursorPosition" value="1"/>
	    <property name="rowMapper" ref="rowMapper"/>
	    <property name="preparedStatementSetter" ref="parameterSetter"/>
	</bean>


In addition to the parameter declarations we need to specify a PreparedStatementSetter implementation that sets the parameter values for the call. This works the same as for the JdbcCursorItemReader above. All the additional properties listed [in the section called “Additional Properties”](http://docs.spring.io/spring-batch/trunk/reference/html/readersAndWriters.html#JdbcCursorItemReaderProperties) apply to the StoredProcedureItemReader as well.
