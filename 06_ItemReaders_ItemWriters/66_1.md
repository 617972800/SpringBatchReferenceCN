## 6.6.1 The FieldSet ##

When working with flat files in Spring Batch, regardless of whether it is for input or output, one of the most important classes is the *FieldSet*. Many architectures and libraries contain abstractions for helping you read in from a file, but they usually return a String or an array of Strings. This really only gets you halfway there. A *FieldSet* is Spring Batchâ€™s abstraction for enabling the binding of fields from a file resource. It allows developers to work with file input in much the same way as they would work with database input. A *FieldSet* is conceptually very similar to a Jdbc *ResultSet*. FieldSets only require one argument, a *String* array of tokens. Optionally, you can also configure in the names of the fields so that the fields may be accessed either by index or name as patterned after *ResultSet*:

	String[] tokens = new String[]{"foo", "1", "true"};
	FieldSet fs = new DefaultFieldSet(tokens);
	String name = fs.readString(0);
	int value = fs.readInt(1);
	boolean booleanValue = fs.readBoolean(2);

There are many more options on the *FieldSet* interface, such as *Date*, long, *BigDecimal*, etc. The biggest advantage of the FieldSet is that it provides consistent parsing of flat file input. Rather than each batch job parsing differently in potentially unexpected ways, it can be consistent, both when handling errors caused by a format exception, or when doing simple data conversions.
