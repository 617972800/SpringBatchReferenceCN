## 6.13.2 自定义 ItemWriter 示例 ##

Implementing a Custom *ItemWriter* is similar in many ways to the *ItemReader* example above, but differs in enough ways as to warrant its own example. However, adding restartability is essentially the same, so it won't be covered in this example. As with the *ItemReader* example, a *List* will be used in order to keep the example as simple as possible:

	public class CustomItemWriter<T> implements ItemWriter<T> {
	
	    List<T> output = TransactionAwareProxyFactory.createTransactionalList();
	
	    public void write(List<? extends T> items) throws Exception {
	        output.addAll(items);
	    }
	
	    public List<T> getOutput() {
	        return output;
	    }
	}

**Making the *ItemWriter* Restartable**

To make the *ItemWriter* restartable we would follow the same process as for the *ItemReader*, adding and implementing the *ItemStream* interface to synchronize the execution context. In the example we might have to count the number of items processed and add that as a footer record. If we needed to do that, we could implement *ItemStream* in our *ItemWriter* so that the counter was reconstituted from the execution context if the stream was re-opened.

In many realistic cases, custom ItemWriters also delegate to another writer that itself is restartable (e.g. when writing to a file), or else it writes to a transactional resource so doesn't need to be restartable because it is stateless. When you have a stateful writer you should probably also be sure to implement *ItemStream* as well as *ItemWriter*. Remember also that the client of the writer needs to be aware of the *ItemStream*, so you may need to register it as a stream in the configuration xml.
