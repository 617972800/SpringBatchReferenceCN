# 6.2 ItemWriter #

**ItemWriter** is similar in functionality to an **ItemReader**, but with inverse operations. Resources still need to be located, opened and closed but they differ in that an **ItemWriter** writes out, rather than reading in. In the case of databases or queues these may be inserts, updates, or sends. The format of the serialization of the output is specific to each batch job.

As with **ItemReader**, **ItemWriter** is a fairly generic interface:

	public interface ItemWriter<T> {
	
	    void write(List<? extends T> items) throws Exception;
	
	}


As with **read** on **ItemReader**, **write** provides the basic contract of **ItemWriter**; it will attempt to write out the list of items passed in as long as it is open. Because it is generally expected that items will be 'batched' together into a chunk and then output, the interface accepts a list of items, rather than an item by itself. After writing out the list, any flushing that may be necessary can be performed before returning from the write method. For example, if writing to a Hibernate DAO, multiple calls to write can be made, one for each item. The writer can then call close on the hibernate Session before returning.
