# 6.5 The Delegate Pattern and Registering with the Step #

Note that the **CompositeItemWriter** is an example of the delegation pattern, which is common in Spring Batch. The delegates themselves might implement callback interfaces **StepListener**. If they do, and they are being used in conjunction with Spring Batch Core as part of a **Step** in a **Job**, then they almost certainly need to be registered manually with the **Step**. A reader, writer, or processor that is directly wired into the Step will be registered automatically if it implements **ItemStream** or a **StepListener** interface. But because the delegates are not known to the **Step**, they need to be injected as listeners or streams (or both if appropriate):

	<job id="ioSampleJob">
	    <step name="step1">
	        <tasklet>
	            <chunk reader="fooReader" processor="fooProcessor" writer="compositeItemWriter"
	                   commit-interval="2">
	                    <streams>
	                    <stream ref="barWriter" />
	                </streams>
	            </chunk>
	        </tasklet>
	    </step>
	</job>
	
	<bean id="compositeItemWriter" class="...CustomCompositeItemWriter">
	    <property name="delegate" ref="barWriter" />
	</bean>
	
	<bean id="barWriter" class="...BarWriter" />
