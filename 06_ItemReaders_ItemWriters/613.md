# 6.13 Creating Custom ItemReaders and ItemWriters #


So far in this chapter the basic contracts that exist for reading and writing in Spring Batch and some common implementations have been discussed. However, these are all fairly generic, and there are many potential scenarios that may not be covered by out of the box implementations. This section will show, using a simple example, how to create a custom *ItemReader* and *ItemWriter* implementation and implement their contracts correctly. The *ItemReader* will also implement *ItemStream*, in order to illustrate how to make a reader or writer restartable.
