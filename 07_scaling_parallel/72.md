#7.2 并行 Steps

As long as the application logic that needs to be parallelized can be split into distinct responsibilities, and assigned to individual steps then it can be parallelized in a single process. Parallel Step execution is easy to configure and use, for example, to execute steps (**step1**,**step2**) in parallel with **step3**, you could configure a flow like this:

	<job id="job1">
	    <split id="split1" task-executor="taskExecutor" next="step4">
	        <flow>
	            <step id="step1" parent="s1" next="step2"/>
	            <step id="step2" parent="s2"/>
	        </flow>
	        <flow>
	            <step id="step3" parent="s3"/>
	        </flow>
	    </split>
	    <step id="step4" parent="s4"/>
	</job>
	
	<beans:bean id="taskExecutor" class="org.spr...SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor"/>


The configurable "task-executor" attribute is used to specify which TaskExecutor implementation should be used to execute the individual flows. The default is **SyncTaskExecutor**, but an asynchronous TaskExecutor is required to run the steps in parallel. Note that the job will ensure that every flow in the split completes before aggregating the exit statuses and transitioning.

See the section on [Section 5.3.5, “Split Flows”](http://docs.spring.io/spring-batch/trunk/reference/html/configureStep.html#split-flows) for more detail.
