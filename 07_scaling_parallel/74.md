Spring Batch also provides an SPI for partitioning a Step execution and executing it remotely. In this case the remote participants are simply Step instances that could just as easily have been configured and used for local processing. Here is a picture of the pattern in action:

![partitioning-overview](./partitioning-overview.png)

The Job is executing on the left hand side as a sequence of Steps, and one of the Steps is labelled as a Master. The Slaves in this picture are all identical instances of a Step, which could in fact take the place of the Master resulting in the same outcome for the Job. The Slaves are typically going to be remote services, but could also be local threads of execution. The messages sent by the Master to the Slaves in this pattern do not need to be durable, or have guaranteed delivery: Spring Batch meta-data in the **JobRepository** will ensure that each Slave is executed once and only once for each Job execution.

The SPI in Spring Batch consists of a special implementation of Step (the **PartitionStep**), and two strategy interfaces that need to be implemented for the specific environment. The strategy interfaces are **PartitionHandler** and **StepExecutionSplitter**, and their role is show in the sequence diagram below:

![](./partitioning-spi.png)

The Step on the right in this case is the "remote" Slave, so potentially there are many objects and or processes playing this role, and the PartitionStep is shown driving the execution. The PartitionStep configuration looks like this:

	<step id="step1.master">
	    <partition step="step1" partitioner="partitioner">
	        <handler grid-size="10" task-executor="taskExecutor"/>
	    </partition>
	</step>

Similar to the multi-threaded step's throttle-limit attribute, the grid-size attribute prevents the task executor from being saturated with requests from a single step.

There is a simple example which can be copied and extended in the unit test suite for Spring Batch Samples (see ***PartitionJob.xml** configuration).

Spring Batch creates step executions for the partitions called "step1:partition0", etc., so many people prefer to call the master step "step1:master" for consistency. With Spring 3.0 you can do this using an alias for the step (specifying the **name** attribute instead of the **id**).

## 7.4.1 PartitionHandler ##

The **PartitionHandler** is the component that knows about the fabric of the remoting or grid environment. It is able to send **StepExecution** requests to the remote Steps, wrapped in some fabric-specific format, like a DTO. It does not have to know how to split up the input data, or how to aggregate the result of multiple Step executions. Generally speaking it probably also doesn't need to know about resilience or failover, since those are features of the fabric in many cases, and anyway Spring Batch always provides restartability independent of the fabric: a failed Job can always be restarted and only the failed Steps will be re-executed.

The **PartitionHandler** interface can have specialized implementations for a variety of fabric types: e.g. simple RMI remoting, EJB remoting, custom web service, JMS, Java Spaces, shared memory grids (like Terracotta or Coherence), grid execution fabrics (like GridGain). Spring Batch does not contain implementations for any proprietary grid or remoting fabrics.

Spring Batch does however provide a useful implementation of **PartitionHandler** that executes Steps locally in separate threads of execution, using the **TaskExecutor** strategy from Spring. The implementation is called **TaskExecutorPartitionHandler**, and it is the default for a step configured with the XML namespace as above. It can also be configured explicitly like this:

	<step id="step1.master">
	    <partition step="step1" handler="handler"/>
	</step>
	
	<bean class="org.spr...TaskExecutorPartitionHandler">
	    <property name="taskExecutor" ref="taskExecutor"/>
	    <property name="step" ref="step1" />
	    <property name="gridSize" value="10" />
	</bean>

The **gridSize** determines the number of separate step executions to create, so it can be matched to the size of the thread pool in the **TaskExecutor**, or else it can be set to be larger than the number of threads available, in which case the blocks of work are smaller.

The **TaskExecutorPartitionHandler** is quite useful for IO intensive Steps, like copying large numbers of files or replicating filesystems into content management systems. It can also be used for remote execution by providing a Step implementation that is a proxy for a remote invocation (e.g. using Spring Remoting).

## 7.4.2 Partitioner ##

The Partitioner has a simpler responsibility: to generate execution contexts as input parameters for new step executions only (no need to worry about restarts). It has a single method:

	public interface Partitioner {
	    Map<String, ExecutionContext> partition(int gridSize);
	}

The return value from this method associates a unique name for each step execution (the **String**), with input parameters in the form of an **ExecutionContext**. The names show up later in the Batch meta data as the step name in the partitioned **StepExecutions**. The **ExecutionContext** is just a bag of name-value pairs, so it might contain a range of primary keys, or line numbers, or the location of an input file. The remote **Step** then normally binds to the context input using **#{...}** placeholders (late binding in step scope), as illustrated in the next section.

The names of the step executions (the keys in the **Map** returned by **Partitioner**) need to be unique amongst the step executions of a Job, but do not have any other specific requirements. The easiest way to do this, and to make the names meaningful for users, is to use a prefix+suffix naming convention, where the prefix is the name of the step that is being executed (which itself is unique in the **Job**), and the suffix is just a counter. There is a **SimplePartitioner** in the framework that uses this convention.

An optional interface **PartitioneNameProvider** can be used to provide the partition names separately from the partitions themselves. If a **Partitioner** implements this interface then on a restart only the names will be queried. If partitioning is expensive this can be a useful optimisation. Obviously the names provided by the **PartitioneNameProvider** must match those provided by the **Partitioner**.

## 7.4.3 Binding Input Data to Steps ##

It is very efficient for the steps that are executed by the PartitionHandler to have identical configuration, and for their input parameters to be bound at runtime from the ExecutionContext. This is easy to do with the StepScope feature of Spring Batch (covered in more detail in the section on [Late Binding](http://docs.spring.io/spring-batch/trunk/reference/html/configureStep.html#late-binding)). For example if the **Partitioner** creates **ExecutionContext** instances with an attribute key **fileName**, pointing to a different file (or directory) for each step invocation, the **Partitioner** output might look like this:

**Table 7.1. Example step execution name to execution context provided by Partitioner targeting directory processing**

	| Step Execution Name (key) |	ExecutionContext (value)  |
	| filecopy:partition0	    |   fileName=/home/data/one   |
	| filecopy:partition1	    |   fileName=/home/data/two   |
	| filecopy:partition2	    |   fileName=/home/data/three |

Then the file name can be bound to a step using late binding to the execution context:

	<bean id="itemReader" scope="step"
	      class="org.spr...MultiResourceItemReader">
	    <property name="resource" value="#{stepExecutionContext[fileName]}/*"/>
	</bean>
