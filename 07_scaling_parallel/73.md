# 7.3 远程分块(Chunking)

In Remote Chunking the Step processing is split across multiple processes, communicating with each other through some middleware. Here is a picture of the pattern in action:

The Master component is a single process, and the Slaves are multiple remote processes. Clearly this pattern works best if the Master is not a bottleneck, so the processing must be more expensive than the reading of items (this is often the case in practice).

The Master is just an implementation of a Spring Batch **Step**, with the ItemWriter replaced with a generic version that knows how to send chunks of items to the middleware as messages. The Slaves are standard listeners for whatever middleware is being used (e.g. with JMS they would be **MesssageListeners**), and their role is to process the chunks of items using a standard **ItemWriter** or **ItemProcessor** plus **ItemWriter**, through the **ChunkProcessor** interface. One of the advantages of using this pattern is that the reader, processor and writer components are off-the-shelf (the same as would be used for a local execution of the step). The items are divided up dynamically and work is shared through the middleware, so if the listeners are all eager consumers, then load balancing is automatic.

The middleware has to be durable, with guaranteed delivery and single consumer for each message. JMS is the obvious candidate, but other options exist in the grid computing and shared memory product space (e.g. Java Spaces).
